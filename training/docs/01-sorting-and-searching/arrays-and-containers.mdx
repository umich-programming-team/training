title: Arrays and STL Containers

The goal of reading this subsection is to convince you that using C++ STL containers is beneficial to competitive programming.

:::tip Summary
Use static or size-fixed arrays, or STL vectors.

Now, I will introduce two reasons for using STL containers.

## Reason 1: Containers Have Lengths Info

Once you have a container, you can use `std::sort()` to sort them.

### Example: [[CF1399A] Remove Smallest](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1399/A)

#### Short Description

You are given an array of $n$ positive integers. Each time you can choose two integers where their absolute difference is no more than $1$, and eliminate the smaller one. Answer `YES` if there is a way to eliminate integers until exactly one number left.

#### Solution

If there is a way to eliminate all but one integer, then the remaining one must be of the largest value. Thus, we can sort the array and see if for any non-largest integer can be eliminated.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    // Declare an array of size n dynamically.
    vector<int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i];

    sort(a.begin(), a.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (a[i + 1] > a[i] + 1) {
            cout << "NO" << '\n';
            return;
        }
    }
    cout << "YES" << '\n';
    return;
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) solve();
    return 0;
}
```

## Reason 2: Containers Could Have Iterators

Using the iterators, your code looks more simpler and easier to understand.
This is super helpful when you are using ranged for-loops.

### Example: [[CF1220A] Cards](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1220/A)

#### Short Description

You are given a **shuffled** string from reading a sequence of binary digits in English. Restore the maximum possible number in binary notation.

#### Solution

We notice that the number of `z` characters represents the number of zeros, and the number of `n` characters represents the number of ones. Hence, our algorithm starts with counting the number of such charaters, and output all the `1`'s before `0`'s.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    string S;
    cin >> n >> S;

    int count_z = 0, count_n = 0;
    // Here we use a ranged for-loop over a container.
    for (char x : S) {
        if (x == 'z') count_z++;
        if (x == 'n') count_n++;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < count_n; ++i) cout << "1 ";
    for (int i = 0; i < count_z; ++i) cout << "0 ";
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Note: on Codeforces, the autograder allows you to print a trailing space at the end of the line. This might not pass on the other online judges.

With these handy containers in C++, we are able to apply sorting to lots of challenges in a very handy way!
