Hi, welcome to UMich Programming Team!
In this section we will be describing what is **competitive programming** and what is the **ICPC**.

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming), competitive programming is a _mind sport_ where participants program according to provided specifications.
Competitive programming is recognized and supported by several tech companies, such as Google and Facebook.
They sponsor programming competitions such as [Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam) and [Hackercup](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/) every year.

International Collegiate Programming Contest ([ICPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest)) is one of the oldest competitive programming contest. ICPC orignated in the 1970 from Texas, and goes from multi-tier in 1977 to world-wide since 1989. Every year over 120 teams advance to the world finals, competing for the championship with universities from all over the world.
University of Michigan Programming Team won the second place in the 2011 world finals, and has advanced to the world finals many times in the past.

## Regionals


Each year, University of Michigan participate in the East Central North America Regional ([ECNA](http://icpc-ecna.ysu.edu/)). Starting from 2020, top teams from the ECNA regionals, as well as top teams from the other 10 regionals in the north America are advanced to the North America Championship ([NAC](https://nac.icpc.global/)). At least 19 teams from NAC advance to the world finals.
