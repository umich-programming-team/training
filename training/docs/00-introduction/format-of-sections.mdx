title: Format of Training Sections
sidebar_label: 0.4 Training Sections
---

Each training section will provide a few concepts that are useful for competitive programming, and then a set of practice problems.
The practice problems are collected in our [Codeforces group](https://codeforces.com/group/62c8bIEN9G/contests). You can either participate as a virtual contest or simply practice over the problemset.

## Suggested Prerequisites

There is no actual prerequisites to any competitive programming contests. However, if you are equipped with some knowledge from algorithms, data structures and discrete math, it would be very helpful.

## Overview of the Sections

### Section 1 to 5:

We will be covering basic algorithm paradigms, and provide a certain implementations.
For people who use C++, we will introduce lots of examples using standard library (STL) that reduces a lot of effort of implementation.

### Section 6 to 15:

In the subsequent sections we will have a deeper dive into different competitive-programming favored knowledges and tips. These sections are designed to not have too much dependencies between each other. However, in general these sections are sorted roughly by their difficulty.

### Section 16 and beyond:

These are advanced topics, in the sense that they are rarely appearing in every contest but they will sporatically appear in some contests. We recommend the readers to fully understand all the materials from Sections 1 to 15.
